            This survey aims to analyze consumer preferences for different laptop brands and
            identify factors influencing their choices. The data reveals that HP is the most
            preferred brand, followed closely by Asus, Dell, and Lenovo, indicating their strong
            market presence and reputation for reliability, affordability, and performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            HP’s dominance suggests that consumers value durability, diverse product offerings,
            and strong after-sales support. Asus is recognized for gaming and high-performance
            models, while Dell remains a popular choice for students and professionals. Lenovo’s
            appeal lies in its budget-friendly yet reliable options, making it a strong competitor in
            the market.
        </p>
        <p>
            Brands like Acer and Apple have moderate user preference. Acer attracts budget-conscious
            buyers, while Apple’s MacBooks cater to users who prioritize premium design, security, and
            seamless ecosystem integration. However, Apple’s high price point may limit its accessibility
            to a broader audience.
        </p>
        <p>
            Honor ranks the lowest in consumer preference, which may be due to low brand
            recognition, limited availability, or a lack of competitive features. To strengthen its
            position, Honor needs to focus on enhanced marketing, improved product features, and
            wider distribution channels.
        </p>
        <p>
            The results highlight that brand reputation, performance, affordability, and features
            play a critical role in consumer decision-making. Established brands continue to
            dominate due to their strong customer trust, while lesser-known brands face challenges
            in gaining market traction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ultimately, this survey provides valuable insights into current market trends and
            consumer expectations, emphasizing the need for brands to continuously innovate,
            improve customer engagement, and offer competitive pricing to stay relevant in the
            evolving laptop industry.
